Trying to establish if we can use this dataset to understand more about hypothyroidism- especially when comorbid conditions present.
EDA and data file creation done by EDAPFeercise.R
The EDA analysis shows missing data, which drove the approach of a language model.
I recognize this is a self-referential approach to NLP, but the idea can be applied more broadly to try to find that missing data in free text.
Language models take the file produced in EDA as input.
The language models take a long time to train. Highly suggest looking at the heatmap output for why this was valuable.
The Language Model and Topic Model were done in Colab, so input files needed to be loaded to google bucket. 
Presentation and SQL answers in documents.
